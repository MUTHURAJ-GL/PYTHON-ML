USED PYTHON : 
         Working with structured data using Data Frame and Series, Statistical data visualization, for creating various plots like line, scatter, bar, and histograms.
USED ML : 
        Train Test Split: Technique for splitting data into training and testing sets
                          to assess model performance.
Logistic Regression: Method for predicting the probability of a binary
                     outcome using the logistic function.
Accuracy: Metric measuring the proportion of correctly classified instances in
          a classification model.
Sklearn: Python's Scikit-learn, a powerful machine learning library providing
         tools for data analysis and model building.

This dataset is originally from the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases. The objective of the dataset is to diagnostically predict whether a patient has diabetes based on certain diagnostic measurements included in the dataset. Several constraints were placed on the selection of these instances from a larger database. In particular, all patients here are females at least 21 years old of Pima Indian heritage.

Predictive analysis is a type of analysis where this means understanding the probable future trends and behavior.To derive predictions from the given dataset, I partitioned the data into
independent and dependent variables. Upon analysis, I observed that all seven variables i.e. Pregnancies, Glucose, Blood pressure, skin thickness, Insulin, BMI , Diabetes, Age are independent, while 'Outcome' serves as the dependent variable.
